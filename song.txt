I have arrived in a world ruled by chaos and evil
Darkness enfolds the land that I once called my home
Lost in the realm of an ancient and powerful wizard
Now I must quest to take back the Crystalline Throne
Legends speak of a glen
Where truth and justice still reign
Ride far away, cross the mighty river Tay
Over mountains into the unknown
Follow your heart, let it guide you through the dark
To the Land of Unicorns
Follow the path, laid down by the forces of justice
Over the stones and into the mountains of fire
Fighting with trolls and undead defenders of chaos
Onwards I ride in search of the land I desire
Descend out of the mists
The valley of Achnasheen
